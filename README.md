# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird using the Pygame library.

## Description

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The player earns points for successfully passing through the gaps between the pipes.

The game offers two modes: normal and fast. In normal mode, the player can press the "1" key to start the game, while in fast mode, the "2" key is used. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score possible by navigating the bird through the pipes.
